A simple lightweight grocery app<br/>
<p><b>History</b>:
This project started out as a way for my girlfriend to easily make and track her grocery lists during the weekly shopping trips.  There are many list apps out there.  However, I wanted to take what I saw as the best of each of the available options, and combine them into one lightweight app for her convenience.</p>
<p><b>Design</b>:
As a test and challenge to myself, I built this using only pure JavaScript (no libraries), CSS3, HTML5 and PHP.  All the data is stored in a JSON file, that is then uploaded only once to the app.  The JSON data file is manipulated by PHP on the site's back end, while the visual output is displayed on the front.<br/>
The overall design of the app was made keeping both mobile and desktop platforms in mind.  Using viewport heights instead of percentages, it scales evenly across multiple display types.  It was tested on a standard desktop, as well as Android and Apple phones.</p>
<p><b>Future Additions</b>:
Going forward I plan to add an individual user profile function to this.  That will allow individual users to track and work with their own lists, as well as customize it in other ways.  I would also like to incorporate a weekly ad guide for specific stores.</p>
