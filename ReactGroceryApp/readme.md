This is an updated version of my grocery App.
A couple of changes that I plan on implementing here:
1) Technology change.  While the original app was desigend around vanilla JS as a challenge to myself.  Here I plan on challenging my understanding and useage of ReactJS.
2) List adding.  To make it easy to add food to a list you will have the option of uploading a text document that will then be read into the list and populate the different categories.

9/1/19- Initial setup and file structure.  Reviwed my previous iteration and determined how I want to break it down into smaller chunks.
